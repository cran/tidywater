# Fluoride removal model

#' @title Calculate new fluoride concentration after dosing alum.
#'
#' @description Applies equation of the form: raw_f - A*alum^a*ph ^ b * raw_f^c. There is no published model, so it is
#' recommended to fit the coefficients with experimental data. When fitting, the following units must be used:
#' Alum in mg/L as chemical, Fluoride in mg/L, pH in SU. Default coefficients are fit from Sollo et al (1978). This function
#' outputs a water class object with an updated fluoride concentration (which will be in M, per standard water units).
#'
#' @param water Source water object of class "water" created by \code{\link{define_water}}
#' @param alum Amount of hydrated aluminum sulfate added in mg/L: Al2(SO4)3*14H2O + 6HCO3 -> 2Al(OH)3(am) +3SO4 + 14H2O + 6CO2
#' @param coeff Model coefficients to use as vector of numbers.
#'
#' @examples
#' dosed_water <- define_water(ph = 7, temp = 25, alk = 50, f = 4) %>%
#'   chemdose_ph(alum = 50) %>%
#'   chemdose_f(alum = 50)
#'
#' convert_units(dosed_water@f, "f", "M", "mg/L")
#'
#' @export
#'
#' @returns A water class object with an updated fluoride concentration.
